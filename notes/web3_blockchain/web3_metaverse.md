# Web3 and The Metaverse

Web3 is a term used to describe the next generation of the internet. It's a vision of a decentralized, user-owned internet, built on blockchain technology.

To understand Web3, it's helpful to look at its predecessors:

- Web1 (Read-Only): The first generation of the internet, where users were consumers of information from static websites. Think of it as a digital library.

- Web2 (Read-Write): The current internet. We can create content and interact, but our data is owned and controlled by large, centralized companies (Meta, Google, Amazon). We use their platforms, but we don't own them.

- Web3 (Read-Write-Own): This is the future vision. Web3 empowers users by giving them ownership of their data and digital assets through blockchain technology. Instead of trusting a corporation, you place your trust in cryptographic code.

## How Web3 Enables The Metaverse

The Metaverse is a persistent, shared, 3D virtual space where users can interact in real-time. While many companies (like Meta) are building their own versions, the true, decentralized metaverse can only be built with Web3 technologies.

Here's how blockchain and Web3 are the foundation of the metaverse:

- True Digital Ownership: In a traditional online game, if you buy a sword, you don't actually own itâ€”the company does. In a Web3 metaverse, that sword is an NFT that you truly own. You can sell it, trade it, or even use it in a different game if both games are built on the same blockchain.

- Decentralized Governance: Instead of a company's CEO making all the decisions for a virtual world, a decentralized metaverse can be governed by a DAO. Users who own the land or assets in the virtual world can vote on its future.

- A Real Economy: The metaverse has its own currency and financial services. You can earn money by playing games (play-to-earn), selling virtual real estate, or creating digital art. This is all made possible by smart contracts and cryptocurrencies that are owned by the users, not a central company.

## Key Projects

Two of the most well-known decentralized metaverse projects are:

- Decentraland (MANA): An open, virtual world on the Ethereum blockchain where users can buy, sell, and build on virtual land (LAND tokens, which are NFTs).

- The Sandbox (SAND): A virtual world where users can create and trade assets and gaming experiences. It has partnered with major brands like Adidas and Snoop Dogg, showing the real-world interest in a decentralized metaverse.
