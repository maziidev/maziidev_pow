# ORACLES

Blockchains are deterministic and isoated. The oracle problem is one of the biggest challenges in the blockchain space.

Blockchains can't access data from outside their own network

An oracle is a service that solves this problem. It is a bridge that connects blockchain to the outside world, allowing smart contracs to access off chain data and events.
