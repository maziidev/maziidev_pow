# DeFi -> DECENTRALIZED FINANCE

this is a new blockchain financia system that aims to recreate traditional financia services in a way that is open, transparent and accessibe to anyone, anywhere in the world

DeFi uses smart contract to automate and enforce financia agreements

It gives room for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a middle man.

## core building block

1. smart contracts -> the backbone of every defi protocol
2. tokens -> all assests in the defi ecosystem from stablecoins to governance tokens. all built with the erc-20 standard
3. decentralized exchange (DEX) -> allow users to trade with others directy
