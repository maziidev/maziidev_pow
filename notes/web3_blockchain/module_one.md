# What is a Blockchain? (Disruptive Technology)

Blockchain is a special kind of database or digitial ledger that is distributed, immutable and transparent.

- Distributed meaning it is not stored in one central location like the way or traditional databsese are. copies are spread across different computers all over the world

- Immutablity and transparent meaning data that is added on the blockchain in form of blocks cant change or deleted meaning they are tampered proof.

These blocks are added chronologically

## Decentralization

Decentralization is a word used a lot in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
Decentralization is the process of distributing control and decision making from a central authority or entity to a distributed network.

In a decentralized system, there is no single point of control
they are shared across thousands of independent computers around the world. These computers often called nodes works together to verify and record transactions, and all the decision making is done based on a consensus mechanism among the network participants.

### Importance of Decentralization for blockchain

- trustless: third parties are not trusted for anything. consensus mechanism handles everything
- censorship-resistant: no single central authority can shut the network down
- security and redundancy: incredibly difficult for a single hacker or small group to corrupt the entire network

> Decentralization is the fundamental design principle that removes the need for a central authority, making a blockchain system more secure, resilient and open.

## Why Blockchain Matters

1. Eliminating the middleman: middlemen services can be a bit slow and they hold control over our data. using blockchian, we have direct peer to peer interactions without the need for a trusted third party. This can also lead to lower cost, faster trnx and more direct control over our assets and information.

2. Enhancing Security and Transparency: in centralized db, they are all single point of failure and once hacked, the entire system is compromised. in the decentralized network, blockchains are immutable and secured. Every trnx are cryptographically linked and distributed across the network.

3. Empowering Digital Identity and Data Ownership: blockchain helps to enable self sovereign identity where you own your own digital identity and data.

4. Creating trust in a trustless Environment: Blockchain provides a way to establish trust without a central authority. The trust is built into the technology itselg through cryptography and the consensus of the network, creating a trustless system in the sense that we dont need to trust any individual person or company.

## Blockchain Structure

Blockchain =  Chain of Blocks

### What is a block?

A block is a container that holds a collection of data (verified transactions). Each block has three key parts:

1. Data: this is the list of transactions
2. Unique Identifier (Hash): long string of numbers and letters generated by a cryptographic function. Any tiny change to the data in the block will completely change its hash.
3. Previous Block's Hash: this is the crucial element that creates the chain. Each new block stores the hash of the block that came before it.

#### How Blocks form a chain

- block 1: the genesis block
- block 2: contains its own data, its own unique hash but it also contains the hash of the block 1
- block 3: same as block 2 but it contains the hash of block 2. the process continues

chain structure is so secure. like the linking mechanism is what makes blockchain immutable or tamper proof

### Blockchain operation

- initiation: user create and signs a transaction with their private key
- broadcasting: the trnx is sent to all nodes
- verification: miners/validators verify the trnx and group it into a block
- consensus: the network agress on the new block through a mechanism like proof of work or proof of stake.
- addition: the new block is added to the blockchain, making the transaction permanent

in bitcoin, the nodes are called miners and validators in ethereum 2.0

### Applications and uses

1. Financial Services
2. Supply chain management
3. Healthcare
4. Digital Identity
5. Voting and Governance
